# mfs-auth
MFServices - Authentication service

This is a first iteration of an authentication and authorisation service to be used with my personal applications and projects. 

For now it is simply making use of an open source Identity and Access Management system called Keycloak.

As needs and requirements arise, I might further configure or even extend this system or maybe write one from scratch for learning purposes.
